# LinuxCatalog

## Description:
A webpage where you can find all the information you need to start with Linux. It is more an index of links that you can use to navigate from a central point.

## Specs:
- Three main sections: "**DISTROS**", "**BUILD**", "**BLOCKS**"
  - **DISTROS**: A list of the most popular distros. When you tap on the last element, you will be redirected to a new page containing the (almost) complete list of linux dstros.
  - **BUILD**: A section where you can create your custom distro based on Arch Linux. You will be redirected to a page with all the _blocks_ from which you can choose.
  - **BLOCKS**: A rection where you can search for all the _blocks_ for name or function. It's a trimmed down version, only showing you the most popular ones. You can go to a new page where you'll find the complete list. [comment]: # (Maybe this sectoin show be just a searchbar and a button to take you to the complete list.)
-  A **nav bar** at the top to navigate up or down in the page.
- Clickable objets in each section which takes you to a full-page of that section.
- Animations.
